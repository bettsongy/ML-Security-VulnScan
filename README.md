# ML-Security-VulnScan

## Project Overview
ML-Security-VulnScan is a machine learning-powered tool aimed at detecting security vulnerabilities in source code. By leveraging a dataset of annotated code samples, the tool can identify and flag potential security issues, such as SQL injections, cross-site scripting, and buffer overflows.

## Dataset
The project uses the [Source Code Vulnerability Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/source-code-vulnerability) dataset from Kaggle, which includes a variety of source code snippets labeled with security vulnerabilities.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- pip package manager

### Installation
